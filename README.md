# DatabaseIntegrationPractice
This repository is intended to be a practice space to work on my skills as a developer. Through my internship experiences I've gotten to work on full-stack development projects,
but I've realized that in my personal programming in and out of my coursework I don'th have much experience with full-stack development. I will be starting my growth as a
full-stack developer beginnig here in this repository as I work on developing my skills, beginning with understanding how to integrate SQL Server databases with C# to create
applications.
